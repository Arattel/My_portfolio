# My_portfolio
This repository is a kind of meta-repository, in which all my Data Science/Data Analytics/Data Visualization projects are listed  


## Data Science 

### Skin Cancer Lesions classification 

* Computer Vision
* Deep Learning
* Pytorch

In this project classification of skin lesions with 7 different diagnoses was performed using CNN. Also image feature extraction  using `Radiomics ` library was performed.

### Flappy Bird game bot

* Reinforcement learning
* OpenAI Gym
* NEAT
* Deep Learning

In this project we've written a Python library for NEAT(Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) and also used another Python library for generating a NEAT model for passing Flappy Bird tubes. We've obtained the best result at about 100 tubes passed.

### Icons generation using Deep Learning

* Deep Learning
* Variational Autoencoder
* GAN/DCGAN

My solution was to train 3 types of models: Variational Autoencoder, Vanilla GAN and DCGAN and compare their results. Using manual evaluation, we can say that results from a Vanilla GAN were not usable, because they lacked sharpness and picked only some very basic patterns. In case of Variational Autoencoder, results were much more icon-like, but too messy. But result of DCGAN is the best of three methods used, because it picked more complicated patterns. 

Using Fréchet Inception Distance, I obtained such scores:

VAE:207.78051490473
GAN:231.48718670124913
DCGAN: 174.6729527334411

### Time series analysis and prediction of production in Malaysia

* Deep Learning
* LSTM, 1dCNN
* AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA 
* Classic ML

Time series analysis and prediction of production in Malaysia
In this project, I tried to predict agricultural production of some products in Malaysia by historical data. The yearly forecast was obtained using several ways: using AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA models, using classical ML methods like Lasso Regression, but also using Deep Learning technologies like 1d CNN and LSTM.

### Link between Simpsons sentiment and sentiment in mass media in USA(1990-2017)  


* NLP
* Data Gathering
* Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Imputation
* Statistics

In this project, I analyzed sentiment in USA society and compared it with the sentiment in The Simpsons TV show for further insights. The biggest part of the project consisted of data imputation, data gathering, and merging. The main insight was inconclusive. Also, I was trying to find patterns.

### Using Google PageRank algorithm to determine the ”main” character of Game of Thrones

* Data Gathering
* Linear Algebra
* PageRank

We   have parsed the  scripts  to collect  the data,  constructed  the  character  interaction graphs,  and  then implemented the  algorithm, which yielded us characters of Game of Thrones ranked.
